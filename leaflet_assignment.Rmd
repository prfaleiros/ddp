This assignment is about creating an HTML page with a Leaflet map.

The map contains points from the historic Route 66 from Chicago to St. Louis.

```{r }

# Route 66
# https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/10352292_10153002657827662_1249389169669655994_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&oh=857c27c2290cf9e219d57ad268c4d815&oe=5CC7E127

route_icon <- makeIcon(
	iconUrl = "https://github.com/prfaleiros/ddp/blob/gh-pages/icon.png",
	iconWidth = 31, iconHeight = 31,
	iconAnchorX = 16, iconAnchorY = 16)

df <- read.csv("coords.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

df %>%
	leaflet() %>%
	addTiles() %>%
	addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(), icon = route_icon)


```
